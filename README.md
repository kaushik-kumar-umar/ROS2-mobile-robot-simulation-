# ROS2-mobile-robot-simulation-
ROS2 Mobile Robot Simulation using Gazebo and RViz, featuring custom ROS2 nodes for robot control, sensor data handling, and navigation behavior debugging.

This repository contains a ROS2-based mobile robot simulation developed to explore robot motion, control, and navigation concepts. The project uses Gazebo for physics-based simulation and RViz for visualization, enabling effective debugging and validation of robot behavior in a simulated environment.

Custom ROS2 nodes are implemented to handle robot control and sensor data exchange using standard ROS2 communication mechanisms.
